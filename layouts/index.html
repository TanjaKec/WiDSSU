 		<h2> <p style="margin: 90px"; padding: 20px; align="justify">The Women in Data Science (WiDS) initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and support women in the field. WiDS started as a conference at Stanford in November 2015. Now, WiDS includes a global conference, with 150+ regional events worldwide including a datathon (encouraging participants to hone their skills) and a podcast (featuring leaders in the field talking about their work, and their journeys).
 		<br><br>Our program contains three presentations by women directly engaged within the world of data science, a workshop on how to build and develop a DS communication tool by setting up a website. There will also be a panel discussion relating to the engagement of women in the DS Community with a focus on the local region. To create a more dynamic debate and to facilitate wider engagement the panel discussion will be video linked with R-Ladies Belgrade meetup event.
